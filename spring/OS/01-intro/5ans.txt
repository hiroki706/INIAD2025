    60	RFC 6588                 URN Namespace for ucode              April 2012
    61	
    62	
    63	1.  Introduction
    64	
    65	   ucode [UCODE] is an identifier to be stored in many types of tags
    66	   (not limited to Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags).  Its
    67	   allocation and management is handled by the Ubiquitous ID Center
    68	   [UIDC].  The embedding of ucode in many types of tags (RFID tags,
    69	   optical code, infrared markers, and even sound source) is also
    70	   specified by the Ubiquitous ID Center.
    71	
    72	   The basic length of ucode is 128 bits, but it is extensible in units
    73	   of 128 bits if necessary.
    74	
    75	   ucode has been devised to identify objects and places where existing
    76	   standards do not fit the application needs or the scope of the
    77	   applications or where the allocation policy of existing standards is
    78	   too limited for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), small-scale
    79	   research laboratories at academic institutions, or individual users.
    80	
    81	   Applications that use ucode take advantage of the Internet
    82	   extensively.  Use of ucode is open to anybody.  Those who wish to
    83	   have ucode allocated can do so either by having ucode subspace
    84	   allocated to them directly from the Ubiquitous ID Center [UIDC] or by
    85	   obtaining tags that have pre-stored ucode from so called "providers"
    86	   [UCDMIP].  Such tags are certified as ucode tags [UIDTAG], and the
    87	   reader specifications are published so that there will be many
    88	   readers available for such tags.
    89	
    90	   By having a URN for ucode, we can facilitate the use of ucode in many
    91	   Internet-related devices and software for the benefit of existing and
    92	   future users of ucode and people who will access such tags attached
    93	   to objects and places.  Since an application based on ucode can run
    94	   across organizational boundaries and spread across regions and
    95	   countries, a formal URN Namespace Identifier (NID) assignment for
    96	   'ucode' is requested.

   119	   Declared registrant of the namespace:

   126	   Tel: +81-3-5437-0572
   127	
   128	   Declaration of syntactic structure:
   129	
   130	   The structure of the namespace for 'ucode' using the hexadecimal
   131	   representation of the identifier is as follows using ABNF [RFC5234].
   132	
   133	   UCODE-URN = "urn:ucode:" ucode-name
   134	   ucode-name = "_" ucode-number
   135	   ucode-number = 1*ucode-value
   136	   ucode-value = 32HEXDIG
   137	   HEXDIG         =  DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"
   138	   DIGIT          =  %x30-39
   139	                  ; 0-9
   140	
   141	   NOTE 1:  "1*" at the start of the ucode-number definition is not a
   142	   typo.  Although the currently used ucode [UCODE] is 128 bits (16
   143	   octets), thus requiring 32 hexadecimal characters to represent
   144	   serially, ucode is designed to be extensible in increments of 128
   145	   bits.  So, in the distant future, we may need to repeat the chunks of
   146	   128 bits.  This is why "1*" precedes ucode-value.
   147	
   148	   NOTE 2:  ucode-name starts with a "_" because it is also intended to
   149	   be used as an identifier for XML [W3CXML].  Because an XML tag can't
   150	   start with a digit, an "_" (underscore) is inserted at the beginning
   151	   to make sure ucode-name starts with a non-digit.  For example, the
   152	   128-bit ucode value 0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF, expressed in a
   153	   series of hexadecimal digits, is as follows:
   154	
   155	   urn:ucode:_0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF
   156	
   157	   Relevant ancillary documentation:
   158	
   159	   ucode, the identifier expressed by ucode-number, is managed by the
   160	   Ubiquitous ID Center [UIDC], which is a sub-organization of the
   161	   T-Engine Forum [TEF].  The document "Ubiquitous Code: ucode" [UCODE]
   162	   defines this identifier system.

   174	
   175	   Identifier uniqueness considerations:
   176	
   177	   The 'ucode' namespace is managed by the Ubiquitous ID Center.  The
   178	   Ubiquitous ID Center assigns the identifier, ucode, in such a way
   179	   that the uniqueness of the 'ucode' namespace will be maintained.
   180	
   181	   Identifier persistence considerations:
   182	
   183	   The assignment process guarantees that names are not reassigned and
   184	   that the binding between the name and its resource is permanent,
   185	   regardless of any standards or organizational changes or the
   186	   assignment period.
   187	
   188	   Process of identifier assignment:
   189	
   190	   Names are assigned by the Ubiquitous ID Center and by any entities
   191	   that are sub-delegated by the Ubiquitous ID Center.  This assignment
   192	   process is based on "ucode Management Implementing Procedures"
   193	   [UCDMIP] established by the Ubiquitous ID Center.
   194	
   195	   Process of identifier resolution:
   196	
   197	   The process of identifier resolution is currently based on the "ucode
   198	   Resolution Protocol" [UCSURP].  It will be enhanced by using newer
   199	   recommendations from ITU-T and/or standards from ISO.
   200	
   201	   Rules for lexical equivalence:
   202	
   203	   The entire UCODE-URN is case-sensitive.
   204	
   205	   NOTE: This is an additional restriction imposed on the ucode
   206	   namespace by the requirements of some major applications of ucode in
   207	   existence.  Only capital "A", "B", "C", ..., "F" are allowed as part
   208	   of hexadecimal characters.
   209	
   210	   Conformance with URN syntax:
   211	
   212	   There are no special reserved characters.  The URN of this namespace
   213	   conforms to RFC 2141 [RFC2141] and RFC 3986 [RFC3986].
   214	
   215	   Validation mechanism:
   216	
   217	   No special considerations.
   218	
   219	   Scope:
   220	
   221	   Global.

   230	
   231	3.  IANA Considerations
   232	
   233	   One URN Namespace registration for 'ucode'  (46) has been entered
   234	   into the IANA "Formal URN Namespaces" sub-registry for URN NIDs.
   235	
   236	4.  Namespace Considerations
   237	
   238	   ucode, the identifier expressed by ucode-number, is a unique
   239	   identification number to identify a tangible object or a place.
   240	   Additionally, ucode can be assigned to "content" or "information"
   241	   that does not exist in the real world or a "concept" that is yet more
   242	   abstract.
   243	
   244	   ucode has been devised to identify objects and places where existing
   245	   standards do not fit the application needs or the scope of the
   246	   applications or where the allocation policy of existing standards is
   247	   too limited for SMEs, small-scale research laboratories at academic
   248	   institutions, or individual users.
   249	
   250	   ucode is only an identification number, and its value (or its sub-
   251	   bitfields) does not contain any pre-assigned meaning.  Any relevant
   252	   information about the object or place to which a ucode is assigned is
   253	   stored in a data server that can be reached after a "resolution
   254	   process" [UCSURP].  This resolution process usually occurs over the
   255	   Internet.
   256	
   257	   ucode can be assigned to an object to be identified regardless of the
   258	   type of application.  ucode is expected to be stored in any kind of
   259	   tags (2D optical code, RFID, etc.), and it provides a framework where
   260	   anyone can obtain unique numbers for identification purposes.
   261	
   262	   ucode has been designed to provide the services outlined in ITU-T
   263	   Recommendation F.771 [ITU-T-F771] and to operate in the framework of
   264	   ITU-T Recommendation H.621 [ITU-T-H621].
   265	
   266	   ucode architecture is general enough to cover many applications for
   267	   the users.
   268	
   269	5.  Community Considerations
   270	
   271	   This namespace enables ucode to be stored in tags that are designed
   272	   to store URN.  Also, ucode-related information can be described as
   273	   metadata using the URN namespace.  Thus, the namespace facilitates
   274	   the exchange of descriptions regarding objects and places among
   275	   multiple organizations.
   276

   284	RFC 6588                 URN Namespace for ucode              April 2012
   285	
   286	
   287	   It is expected that many small-scale providers will offer ucode tags
   288	   to small users and that large scale providers will hand out millions
   289	   of tags to users.
   290	
   291	   The resolution servers and applications will be available to general
   292	   users with appropriate access control over the Internet.  The
   293	   published specification for resolver and access services for 'ucode'
   294	   allows the creation of client software for many types of computers
   295	   including small mobile terminals and ever-popular smartphones.
   296	
   297	6.  Security Considerations
   298	
   299	   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   300	   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.
